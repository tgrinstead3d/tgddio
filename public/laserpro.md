Project: LaserPro Studio (The Director's Cut)Role: Lead Designer & DeveloperTimeline: 4 WeeksLive Production Site: www.laserprostudio.comConcept "Director's Cut": [Link to your concept build]1. Executive Summary & ContextLaserPro Studio is a custom fabrication and laser engraving business in Columbus, Ohio. The owner, a skilled welder and educator, needed a digital presence to transition from "hobbyist" to "professional service."The "Director's Cut" Narrative:Every project has constraints. For the initial launch, the client required an extremely lean, budget-conscious build to test the market (The Production Site). However, as a designer, I saw a deeper opportunity to position the brand not just as a service, but as an Industrial Art House.This case study presents the "Director's Cut"—an unconstrained conceptual redesign that demonstrates the full potential of the brand identity, utilizing advanced interaction design and a darker, more premium aesthetic.2. The Challenge: The "Hobbyist" TrapIn the custom engraving market, perception is everything. Many competitors look like "Etsy crafters" working out of a garage.The Goal: Elevate the perception of the studio from "crafts" to "precision engineering."The User Problem: Potential B2B clients (awards, signage) need to feel confident that the studio can handle bulk orders and industrial materials (stainless steel, anodized aluminum), not just wood and plastic.3. The Solution: Industrial Dark ModeTo differentiate from the "crafty" competition (who often use bright, soft colors), I developed a design language rooted in Cyberpunk Industrialism.Key Design Decisions:The "Laser" Aesthetic: I used a deep charcoal background (#0B0C10) to simulate the low-light environment of a laser workshop. This allows the "Cyber Cyan" (#00F0FF) accent color to pop, mimicking the actual color of a CO2 laser beam.Motion as Narrative: The Hero section features a CSS-only "Scanner" animation. A beam of light scans the logo and the content, visually reinforcing the concept of precision scanning and cutting without using heavy video files.Typography: I paired Space Grotesk (a wide, brutalist sans-serif) with JetBrains Mono (a coding font). This combination suggests "Architecture" and "Engineering," appealing directly to the B2B buyer.4. Technical Execution (The Concept Build)While the production site relies on standard CMS tools for ease of client maintenance, the "Director's Cut" was built to showcase front-end performance and interaction.Stack: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JS.Performance: The "Laser Scan" effects are achieved entirely through CSS Keyframes and transform: translate, ensuring 60fps performance even on mobile devices.Masonry Layout: A responsive CSS Grid system handles the portfolio images, allowing vertical (trophies) and horizontal (signage) aspect ratios to coexist in a rigid, organized structure.5. The ResultsThis dual-approach strategy provided value on two fronts:Client Satisfaction: The client received a budget-friendly, functional site (Production) that started generating leads immediately.Brand Roadmap: The "Director's Cut" serves as a North Star for the business. As LaserPro Studio grows, we have a pre-validated design system ready to implement for Phase 2, ensuring the digital presence scales with the company's revenue.[View The Live Concept Prototype ->]
